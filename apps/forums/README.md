# Forums

The `forums` app specifcally replaces the `blog` app and is more precise.

## Models

* `Topic` → an admin-written post for setting up the topics in the forum
* `Reply` → a generic reply which is reviewed and edited by the admin. Admin is emailed when someone posts a reply and the admin will add notes and push a moderated version of the reply and change the flag on the reply type.
