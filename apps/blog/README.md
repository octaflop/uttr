This app should really be called `forums`, but due to requirements confusion, itâ€™s called `blog`.

This app houses the main business logic of the uttr application and allows the moderators (admins) to create topics and allows the readers to participate in replying to topics and voting on topics. 

The templates link to the quick poll in the `polls` app to keep track of the polling, while the discussion board itself stores content in this app.
